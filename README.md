GITHUB
GITHUB DOS
After being added as a GitHub collaborator, the first task is to create a branch.

git add . (Performed within your own branch).

git commit -m (Performed within your own branch) to introduce the branch to the repository.

DO NOT use "git add ." blindly!

git add [file_path] must be used. You can obtain the path by right-clicking the class you will push, selecting "Copy Path," and then "Path From Content Root."

Example: src/test/java/tests/QA_Suleyman/US_10.java

Before starting work on the project, run git pull (on main).

git pull must strictly be done on main, then switch to your own branch and perform a merge.

Continuously check that you are on your branch and NOT on main.

When committing, use -m "date name".

GITHUB DON'TS
Never work directly on main.

Do not push without establishing communication.

If a change is required in a shared area, report back to the Lead.
